This was made for my server because the exiled version isn't ported yet, you can use it if you want but please know there are issues (also code is bad)

Issues:
- Pedestals, Generators and WarheadPanel doesn't work (there are no events for interacting with a generator or warheadpanel, idk how to make it work for pedestals)
- There might be other bugs that I either forgot to include or I haven't tested for them, if you find any of them then make a issue.
